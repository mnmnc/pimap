# pimap
imap email automation with python


This script will (eventually) connect to designated IMAP servers (GMAIL.com, GMX.com, OUTLOOK.com) with configured accounts, *check for unread emails*, get some details about them (including headers) and show all of this in a nice form (possibly ncurses - TBD).
